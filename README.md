# Open Trauma Registry
  Trauma Center verification by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) is considered the gold standard. One ACS requirement is a trauma registry. This registry houses all data regarding the care and outcomes of injured patients. This data is used to aid in the evaluation of care, development of performance improvement and to guide injury prevention activities. Trauma data from ACS verified centers is used collectively to document the number and type of injuries occurring annually for the National Highway Safety Council and the Centers for Disease Control.
